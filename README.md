The robot is designed to prevent the coronavirus epidemic and work at the campus gate. The robot actively moves and controls people within a 10 x 10 meters area, including the campus toll booths. The robot follows the person entering the campus from the toll booths and measures their body temperature using sensors, the robot warns people whose body temperature is dangerous. By using distance sensors, the social distance of people at the campus entrance can be measured, and people who are closer than 1.5 meters be warned by the robot to follow the social distance rules. One of the most important points in combating the virus is wearing a mask. People need to wear masks as well. Using machine learning, it can be checked whether people are wearing their masks properly, and people who do not wear masks will be warned to wear masks. These particular functions used machine learning systems and deep learning algorithms.
